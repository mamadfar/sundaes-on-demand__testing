# Lecture Code

These directories contain files for the React code written:

- in the optional React coding lectures (`x-xx-LECTURE` directories)
- to verify code quiz tests (`x-xx-QUIZ` directories)

### To install

1. Copy the contents of the relevant directory into the `src` directory for your project (if you don't have a project yet, create a new one using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/))

1. Check the _README.md_ file in the directory (if a file with this name exists) for dependencies need to be installed or other additional instructions.
