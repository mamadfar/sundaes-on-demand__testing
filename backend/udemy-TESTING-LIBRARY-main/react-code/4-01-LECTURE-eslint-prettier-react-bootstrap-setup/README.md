**NOTE 1:** You will need to run

```
npm install eslint-plugin-testing-library eslint-plugin-jest-dom bootstrap react-bootstrap
```

after copying the code to `src`, for dependencies that don't come with create-react-app.

**NOTE 2:** Please move the files / directories in `MOVE-TO-TOP-LEVEL` to the top level of the project. From the top level of the project:

```bash
mv src/MOVE-TO-TOP-LEVEL/* .
```

**NOTE 3:** Please move the contents of `MOVE-TO-TOP-PUBLIC` to the `public` directory at the top level of the project (at the same level as `src`). From the top level of the project:

```bash
mv src/MOVE-TO-PUBLIC/* ./public/
```
